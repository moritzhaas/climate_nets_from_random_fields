# Construct and Evaluate Climate Networks from Simulated Random Fields and ERA5 Data

This repository accompanies the paper “Pitfalls of Climate Network Construction - A Statistical Perspective” published at [Journal of Climate](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/36/10/JCLI-D-22-0549.1.xml?tab_body=pdf). It is based on the [climnet](https://github.com/mlcs/climnet) repository.

## Installation

All experiments are implemented in Python 3.9.5.

Install all packages in `requirements.txt`.

Download this repository, move to the `climnet` directory and run `pip install -e .` to install your local version of the climnet package.

During this installation the Cartopy package tends to cause issues. Instead of installing the climnet package, you can also just copy the scripts you need.


## Generating time series from an isotropic random field

If you want to generate time series from an isotropic Gaussian random field on a fixed grid, you can simply do the following:

```Python
import numpy as np
from climnet.myutils import *
from climnet.grid import FeketeGrid
from sklearn.gaussian_process.kernels import Matern

# generate the grid of your choice
grid = FeketeGrid(num_points = 1000)
# lon, lat are 1-dimensional arrays containing the coordinates of the grid points
lon, lat = grid.grid['lon'], grid.grid['lat']
# represent the grid in 3D space
cartesian_grid = spherical2cartesian(lon,lat)

# specify the lag-1 autocorrelation all grid points (here high lag-1 autocorrelation of 0.9)
ar_coeff = 0.9 * np.ones(1000)

# compute the covariance matrix on the grid based on the used kernel (here chordal Matern covariance)
kernel = 1.0 * Matern(length_scale=0.2, nu=1.5)
cov = kernel(cartesian_grid)

# sample time series from the isotropic Gaussian random field on the defined grid with the specified lag-1 autocorrelations
# data is an np.array of shape (n_time, num_gridpoints)
np.random.seed(18360)
data = diag_var_process(ar_coeff, cov, n_time=365)
```

## Introduction

The pipeline for any experiment is:

0)   Specify hyper parameters,
1)   Generate and save data,
2)   Calculate and save network statistics,
3)   Plot results.

Many scripts use a SLURM job array, where each job corresponds to an independent realization of the spatio-temporal random field.

After using a job array, run `compose_stats.py` to compose the stats computed in each run to a single file.

Before plotting, calculate network statistics of ground truth networks: `calc_true_pre.py`

## Reproducing the Experiments

First generate and IGRF data for reuse:
- Simulate an IGRF: `compute_data.py`
- Create a preprocessed data set from downloaded ERA5 data: `make_ds.py`

For parallelized, computationally expensive similarity calculations like the BIKSG Mutual Information estimator:
- Run `compute_empcorrs_parallel.py`
- Compose precalculated parts for the BIKSG mutual information estimator: `compose_BIKSG.py`

- Bundle stats of real data: `realbundle_dens.py`
- Same for simulated data: `realbundle_sim.py`
